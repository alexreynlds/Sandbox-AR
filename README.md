# Sandbox AR

Sandbox AR was a mobile application that I created using unity for a university AR module.

The application lets users scan in physical cards that were created for the project which adds them into their collection on the app.

From their collection they are able to look through the information but most importantly they can scan their environement through the camera and place a 3D model of what the card was for into the real world and inspect it.

A video showcasing the application that was made as part of my submission can be found here: https://youtu.be/5NlwLQIwH4A?si=GW8xZZ81y4JIDVad
